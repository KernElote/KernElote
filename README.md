## Hi there 👋

I'm KernElote — a name inspired by the Linux kernel 🐧 and my love for elote en vaso 🌽(play on words).  
I’m currently working on a degree in networking and learning the command line (my happy place 💻).

## 🌟 A bit about me
- 🚗 Hobbies: Working on cars  
- ⌚ Fun fact: I collect watches  
- 🐧 Leaning Linux and everything CLI (apt-get moo) 

---
*Just exploring, learning, and having fun along the way.*
